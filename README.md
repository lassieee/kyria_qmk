# My custom kyria keymap

This keymap is based on the default, with a few adjustments:  

- encoder disabled to save space for future oled animation
- added custom Wheel of Time image to secondary oled
- removed music play button
- removed Colemak-DH and Dvorac base layer
- base layer: switched `tab` and `ctrl/esc` keys and removed `ctrl` from `ctrl/esc`



The five different layers are as follows:  
1. Base layer: QWERTY
2. Navigation layer
3. Symbols/Numbers layer
4. Function layer
5. Adjust layer
